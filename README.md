## Hello there üëã.. 

I am a young Doctorate from Delft University of Technology and is currently working for Belgium Research Institute VITO.

I work a lot with optimization method for engineering/scientific problems. More specifically, with respect to shape, topology optimization and control theory. If you are interested in such topic I have some pretty interesting repositories for you.

I am currently exploring multi-disciplinary design optimization strategies, learning-method for CFD-based optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. If any of these topics is of you interest please get in touch and maybe we can collaborate.
